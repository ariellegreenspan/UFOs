# UFOs
## Overview of Project:
  The purpose of this analysis was to utilize the programming languages of HTML, Javascript, and CSS to create a website that utilizes and filters through the UFO Javascript data file. The HTML was used to create the format and design of the website data, including paragraph headers, box sizing, and color of backgrounds. CSS was similarly used to contribute to the design of the website. Javascript was employed to loop through the data file to locate the data needed o display on the website.
  
## Results:
  The website can be used to find data on UFO sightings on specific dates, in specific cities, states, and countries, in varying shapes, with various decsriptions. A user to the website can scroll through all the sightings data or filter it based on date, city, state, country, or shape. For example, if one wanted to filter the data for 1/03/2010, one can type 1/03/2010 in the date box and the results would look like the following:
  
  If one wanted to filter the data based on city, one can type the city in the city box and it would filter the data. Using the city Benton as an example, the filtered data would look like the following:
  
  If one wanted to filter the data based on state, one can type the state in the state box and it would filter the data. Using the state NJ as an example, the filtered data would look like the following:
  
  If one wanted to filter the data based on country, one can type the country in the country box and it would filter the data. Using the country US as an example, the filtered data would look like the following:
  
  If one wanted to filter the data based on shape, one can type the shape in the shape box and it would filter the data. Using the shape square as an example, the filtered data would look like the following:
  
  If one wanted to reset the data, one can click the UFO sightings header at the top of the page. See image below for reference:
